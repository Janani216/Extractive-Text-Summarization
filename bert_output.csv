1,"At the start of a big week for the Higgs boson, the most sought-after particle in all of physics, scientists in Illinois said Monday that they had crept closer to proving that the particle exists but had been unable to reach a definitive conclusion.The scientists outlined their final analysis based on more than 10 years of research and 500 trillion particle collisions using the U.S. Department of Energy's Fermilab Tevatron collider near Batavia, Illinois, whose budgetary woes shut it down last year.What is the Higgs boson and why is it important?Their announcement came two days before researchers at the Large Hadron Collider under the Alps are due to unveil their latest results at an eagerly awaited seminar at the CERN particle physics laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland."

5,"(CNN) -- Visits to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine by Japanese officials, including the younger brother of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, ignited criticism from China and Korea, which see the visits as an homage to Japan's past wartime aggressions.Over the weekend several officials, including Abe's brother, senior vice foreign minister Nobuo Kishi, visited the shrine, according to Kyodo News.
""On Sunday, Abe's cabinet minister Keiji Furuya visited the Yasukuni Shrine and maintained that he did not want to ""irritate neighboring nations.""
""The cycle of Japanese politicians visiting Yasukuni, prompting foreign criticisms, is well-worn.
""In a sense, if the Chinese government or Korean government criticizes Japan for doing this, this gives them (Japanese politicians) attention."

That way, we did not have to admit to the world and each other that whatever the Karzai government is -- one of the most corrupt governments in the world, a foundation of a new narcostate -- democracy it ain't, by a long shot.How much our entanglement in Afghanistan is turning into a sad farce became all too clear when President Obama flew to Kabul to tell Karzai that he ought to stop corruption.When, in response, Karzai started negotiating a peace deal with the Taliban, the White House rolled out the red carpet for Karzai and announced that from now on, the U.S. will focus on low-level corruption."

The end of the Soviet Union was understood by many of us not as an end to ideology, but as proof that our ideology was the better one.Just why Eric Hobsbawm thought as he did, wrote as he did, and lived as he did is a matter that is beyond the judgement of any one of his colleagues, and there are people far better equipped than I to judge."

Opponents go on record as well, and when a policy turns out to be popular and successful this makes them much more hesitant to continue their attacks on a program.For decades, Republicans shied away from the kind of oppositional statements toward Medicare proposals uttered by Barry Goldwater and Reagan in the early 1960s for fear that voters would remember how they had stood firm against benefits that turned out to be enormously popular.Obama certainly would prefer to obtain legislation and the turn to executive power is a decision of last resort, one that realistically might be the only way he can achieve anything else in the next few years."

491,"(CNN) -- Cristiano Ronaldo helped Real Madrid move three points clear in Spain ahead of the winter break with his fifth hat-trick this season in Saturday's 6-2 win at Sevilla, as both teams had a player sent off.The Portugal forward claimed outright top spot in the La Liga scoring charts as he moved clear of Lionel Messi, who is in Japan with Barcelona for Sunday's FIFA Club World Cup final against Brazilian side Santos.Real, smarting from last weekend's 3-1 home defeat by the Spanish and European champions, made the perfect start when Ronaldo ran onto Angel Di Maria's threaded pass to net in the 10th minute.Goalkeeper Iker Casillas did well to stop Sevilla making an immediate reply, with the Spain captain pushing Manu's shot onto the post.Sevilla thought they had equalized in the 35th minute but Emir Spahic's effort was ruled out for a marginal offside following Ivan Rakitic's free-kick out wide, and Real doubled the home team's anguish by immediately doubling the lead.Jose Callejon, who like Ronaldo scored in the midweek Copa del Rey first-leg win over third division Ponferradina, was credited with another goal after making enough contact with Di Maria's chip into the box to distract keeper Javi Varas.Ronaldo made it 3-0 in the 41st minute with his 19th league goal this season after being given too much space to shoot from outside the box.However, Real went to the interval reduced to 10 men after defender Pepe was sent off for striking the face of former Madrid striker Alvaro Negredo.Sevilla could not capitalize on that advantage, and Di Maria was finally rewarded in the 66th minute when he ran onto Karim Benzema's first-time pass and coolly slotted low past Varas.Jesus Navas reduced the deficit when he fired through the legs of defender Sergio Ramos in the 69th minute, but Manu was red-carded for a rash tackle from behind on Madrid fullback Alvaro Arbeloa.Ronaldo netted from the penalty spot with five minutes left -- sealing his 13th treble for Real --after Benzema was fouled by Federico Fazio in a challenge that saw the France forward carried off.His replacement Hamit Altintop then scored his first league goal for Real, with the Turkey midfielder netting from Xabi Alonso's low cross.Negredo hit back in the second minute of time added on for his fifth in La Liga to ensure a repeat scoreline from last season's fixture.The defeat left Sevilla 16 points behind Real after 16 games, and facing the prospect of losing fifth place to Malaga -- who visit third-placed Valencia on Sunday.Espanyol moved up to seventh with a 2-1 win at Sporting Gijon that left the Barcelona-based club a point behind Sevilla and Malaga.Sergio Garcia netted the winner with six minutes left, after captain David Barral equalized for third-bottom Gijon with his seventh goal this season in the 61st minute.French teenager Thievy Bifouma put Espanyol ahead after only two minutes as the 19-year-old fired home from outside the box.Athletic Bilbao beat bottom club Real Zaragoza 2-1 to move up to eighth, despite having Spain midfielder Javi Martinez sent off midway through the first half.Leonardo Ponzio put the visitors level from the resulting penalty, but his teammate Maurizio Lanzaro was dismissed for a second booking on 69 and Gaizka Toquero netted the Basque side's winner with three minutes to play.Getafe joined 10th-placed Atletico Madrid on 19 points with a 2-1 win at Real Mallorca as Abdel Barrada netted both goals.Defender Ivan Ramis headed Mallorca into a 10th-minute lead, but Pedro Rios helped 22-year-old French midfielder Barrada score on 28 and 44."

""It might only be a small disc weighing just 175 grams but there are many ways to manipulate it around the playing field.As Poole explains, the two most common throws are backhand and forehand, just like in tennis, and the best players complete pinpoint passes with a simple flick of the wrist.The more complicated maneuvers include the hammer, an overhead throw that travels far faster than either the forehand or backhand, used to quickly switch play from one side of the field to the other.Then there's the scoober, a short flick used to loop the disc over a defender, typically no more than 15 or 20 yards.But despite the variations of throw, Poole's favorite aspect of the game is attempting to catch."

When Republicans pushed for welfare reform in 1996, they drew many ideas from local changes that had been put into place in states such as Wisconsin, which had received waivers from national requirements.The local arena is usually not ideal for creating big domestic policies since it depends on so many actors to sustain, since the politics of each region vary so greatly and since the financial muscle of smaller levels of government is much weaker.Outside Washington's more conservative environment, political conditions in many parts of the United States are producing important opportunities for liberalism to flourish."

""Tourists are on a different schedule than residents, it is incompatible with residential living,"" Prentiss said.The Kailua Neighborhood Board has brought up the issue of illegal short term rentals to the city and the county of Honolulu, but due to the lack of staffing, it has been difficult to enforce the ordinance, Prentiss said.The board plans to re-take the issue in its next meeting in January."
987,"Chinese officials estimate there will be 740 million trips throughout the holiday.Fueled by an increase of cars, motorists encountered long delays, as well as traffic accidents, including a collision of a tour bus on the Beijing-Tianjin highway that killed five Germans and one Chinese person Monday morning, as reported by Xinhua.Photos showed stretches of parked cars dotting roadways and motorists standing outside their cars.
Motorists told the Chinese television station that they were only able to drive about 18 to 24 miles per hour in traffic.The topic ""held up on the highway"" on Sina Weibo, China's most popular microblogging site, generated over 77 million posts.While stuck in gridlock Sunday, some people got creative by walking their dogs, doing push-ups and playing impromptu games of roadside tennis, according to photos compiled by Tea Leaf Nation, a blog that focuses on China.Li Daokui, the director of the Center for China in the World Economy at the Tsinghua University School of Economics and Management, questioned the wisdom of no tolls on holidays."
988,"But then you falter, since getting rid of stuff can be an emotionally charged process.Martha Stewart Living: Spring cleaning to-do list: The 12 things you need to clean""A lot of us hold on to items not because we love them or they're useful, but because we're living in the past or for the future,"" says Monika Eckfield, an assistant professor at California State University East Bay who studies people's relationships with things.Indeed, a lot of us have a hard time letting go, if the 2.3 billion square feet -- or 82.5 square miles -- of self-storage units in the U.S. is any indication."
989,"""The result, says Sanchez-Navarro, is increased algae growth that effectively suffocates the coral, impeding its growth.The reefs off Quintana Roo form part of the Meso American Barrier Reef which stretches over 1000 kilometers from Mexico as far the Bay Islands of Honduras, making it the second longest barrier reef in the world.
These cool the water down in their wake but damage the reefs in other ways: the World Conservation's report, ""Corals -- facing the death sentence"", found that 2005's Hurricane Wilma and Hurricane Emily decreased coral cover from 24 percent to 10 percent in the reefs off Mexico's Cozumel.An occasional storm can actually have a beneficial effect on coral reefs, says Sanchez-Navarro, because the turbulence allows the coral to break off and spread."
990,"Now, you can take a look at some of the biggest and best yachts in existence.Included in our photo gallery are five of the top ten largest and most expensive super-yachts ever built -- and you'll recognize some of the names on the owners' list.Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen's Octopus is inside the top ten, as is Oracle's Larry Ellison, with his vessel Rising Sun.Click here to view a photo gallery of the super-yachts.
Rumored to be called Eclipse, the vessel is expected to overtake Dubai as the largest super-yacht in the world.And it's also tipped to possess two helipads -- because obviously, one is never enough.You won't want to think about how much Eclipse is going to cost, however, because Dubai, the world's current biggest yacht is reportedly worth well over $300 million.Other super-yachts featured in the gallery are Australian businessman James Packer's Arctic P, and a French-owned yacht which French President Nicolas Sarkozy has spent time enjoying on vacation.Which yacht would you most like to own and why?"
991,"(CNN) -- When the first trailer for ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" arrived last week, it posed one of the most pressing questions of our time: Is that new lightsaber design awesome or absolutely ridiculous?In the ""Force Awakens"" clip, we see a hooded figure whip out a lightsaber that has two mini-lightsabers protruding from its sides, essentially forming a lightsaber broadsword.Some fans were immediately all about the new lightsaber, but others were far less impressed.For many, the biggest issue was that the weapon's design seemed flawed.But here's who we hadn't yet heard from in this debate: bona fide ""Star Wars"" superfan Stephen Colbert.You see, Colbert has been a ""Star Wars"" fan for at least two weeks longer than you have, since he won tickets to an advance screening two weeks before the first ""Star Wars"" premiered in 1977."
992,"""Trump, who has indicated that he is considering a run for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination, was the focus of many of the barbs thrown by Obama and head ""Saturday Night Live"" writer Meyers.In Washington, Trump still talk of town""They were pretty personal, but I expected that I was going to be zinged,"" Trump told CNN's Don Lemon on Sunday night.At one point in the presentation, Obama singled out an unsmiling Trump and credited him with making hard decisions -- such as firing Gary Busey over Meat Loaf on an episode of ""The Celebrity Apprentice"" -- and succeeding in his push for the president to release his long-form birth certificate."
993,"The county also had an exceptionally snowy winter this year.Other alternatives to salt have included liquid byproducts, including beer waste and beet juice, according to a study by the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies, a New York state-based environmental group.Some communities are dealing with high costs for both salt and overtime for plow drivers.In Oak Park, Illinois, salt is three times the normal price because of high demand this winter, and overtime for plow workers is adding up.The New Jersey DOT reports that it has spent more than $82 million for snow and ice removal through February 11 of this year, compared with $62 million spent all of last year's winter season.Even before the last storm, more than 372,000 tons of salt had been used in New Jersey this winter, compared with ""last year's 258,000 tons for the whole winter,"" Dee said.5 reasons climate change is back in the newsCNN's Ross Levitt, Maria Santana, and Allie Malloy contributed to this report."
994,"Bayern's lone blip was losing the German Super Cup to Borussia Dortmund in July.Raja Casablanca failed in its bid to become the first African side to win the competition, although the Moroccan champion did well to reach the finale after upsetting South America's Atletico Mineiro.Bayern was hardly threatened, even without the likes of Arjen Robben, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Mario Mandzukic, Javi Martinez and Mario Gotze in the starting lineup, and scored twice within 25 minutes to end any hopes of a shock upset.Brazilian defender Dante put Bayern ahead in the seventh minute when he was unmarked in the penalty area and Raja Casablanca keeper Khalid Askri made two good saves before Thiago Alcantara's strike in the 22nd doubled the score.And only a minor miracle, it seems, can stop Bayern from repeating as German champion after its main rivals stumbled Saturday.Bayer Leverkusen lost its second straight league game, 1-0 at Werder Bremen, while Borussia Dortmund -- Bayern's victim in the Champions League final -- fell 2-1 at home to promoted Hertha Berlin.It was Dortmund's fourth defeat in the past six games so the Bundesliga's Christmas break falls at just the right time for Jurgen Klopp's men."

Morrissey expressed remorse to the women Irving raped and apologized for the long wait for justice.
Irving never returned.Instead, he fled Massachusetts and landed on the state's Most Wanted list, where he remained for 34 years.After he fled, Irving's profile was featured on the TV shows ""America's Most Wanted,"" ""Unsolved Mysteries"" and ""Real Stories of the Highway Patrol,"" according to the Most Wanted poster.Police found Irving at his Gorham, Maine, home in March, where he had been living under the name Gregg Irving, the name of his younger brother, said Massachusetts State Police spokesman Dave Procopio in a statement.Police would not divulge what led authorities to Irving."
996,"The figures for tornadoes' wind speeds are based on assessments of the damage they leave behind on the ground.Only 59 EF5 storms have hit the United States since 1950, according to weather service records.
The latest one devastated Moore, Oklahoma, in May of last year.Though meteorologists have not finished analyzing the most recent Arkansas storm, so far the state has been spared an EF5, the NWS says.CNN meteorologist Chad Myers estimates that the winds that ravaged the town of Mayflower, Arkansas, on Sunday had speeds of 130 to 150 mph, which would correspond to an EF3 tornado, which the Fujita Scale describes as ""severe."

""It didn't impact the state in such a manner that people considered changing the rules and regulations, so all of this was done with very little positive results,"" said Abraham Pizam, a tourism professor and dean of the hospitality management college at the University of Central Florida in Orlando, which is also home to Disney World.Protesters stand up to 'stand your ground,' but laws likely here to stayBut the center said the boycott did send a warning: ""Other states considering immigration legislation should pause before rushing to adopt measures like (the Arizona law) S.B."
998,"We'll need the intelligence agencies to be equally accurate and equally firm in their judgments when it comes to the Taliban talks.Intelligence may be able to help in other ways since it has been routine for American intelligence officials to meet with and come to agreement with foreign counterparts, many of whom share little of our world view, our values or even our interests.A good thing, too, since one of the continuities between Presidents Bush and Obama has been the willingness to work with some unsavory partners such as President Ali Abdullah Saleh of Yemen or several recent incarnations of Pakistan's ISI.I can recall many a meeting with counterparts where the common space where we might find agreement was challengingly small.In some of those sessions, my counterpart would depart the seemingly fact-based dialogue we had been sharing and launch into a series of conclusions based more on his culture's creation mythology than on any shared reality I could identify.For a time, I thought it sufficient to simply avoid signaling any agreement at these moments and patiently tolerate the excursion."
