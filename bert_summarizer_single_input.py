#           which has been launched to empower the next generation of students with AI-ready skills.
#          Envisioned as a three-year collaborative program, Intelligent Cloud Hub will support around 100
#           institutions with AI infrastructure, course content and curriculum, developer support,
#           development tools and give students access to cloud and AI services.
#           As part of the program, the Redmond giant which wants to expand its reach and is
#           planning to build a strong developer ecosystem in India with the program will set up the
#           core AI infrastructure and IoT Hub for the selected campuses.
#           The company will provide AI development tools and Azure AI services such as
#           Microsoft Cognitive Services, Bot Services and Azure Machine Learning.
#           According to Manish Prakash, Country General Manager-PS, Health and Education,
#           Microsoft India, said, "With AI being the defining technology of our time,
#           it is transforming lives and industry and the jobs of tomorrow will
#           require a different skillset. This will require more collaborations and
#           training and working with AI. That’s why it has become more critical than ever for
#           educational institutions to integrate new cloud and AI technologies.
#           The program is an attempt to ramp up the institutional set-up and build
#           capabilities among the educators to educate the workforce of tomorrow."
#           The program aims to build up the cognitive skills and in-depth understanding of
#           developing intelligent cloud connected solutions for applications across industry.
#           Earlier in April this year, the company announced Microsoft Professional
#           Program In AI as a learning track open to the public.
#           The program was developed to provide job ready skills to programmers who wanted to hone their
#           skills in AI and data science with a series of online courses which featured hands-on labs and expert instructors as well.
#           This program also included developer-focused AI school that provided a bunch of assets to help build AI skills."""
