# Extractive-Text-Summarization

The problem statement we are trying to solve is extractive text summarization, which involves
generating a concise and meaningful summary from a document by identifying relevant sentences.
We are looking for approaches to improve the diversity and reduce the redundancy in the generated
summary, and analyzing the effectiveness of architectures such as Word2Vec, BERT and ELMo in
this task.

We have analyzed the impact of different word representations on the extractive summarization task based on a centroid approach, which is based on the geometric meaning of the centroid vector of a document and identifies sentences which have a high similarity score to the centroid to be part of the summary. 
A concise and diverse summary can only be generated if the sentence and centroid representations effectively capture context and semantics of the words. The main research topic we are focusing on is whether models such as Word2Vec, BERT and ELMo succeed in generating such a diverse and concise summary.
