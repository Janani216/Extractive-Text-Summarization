1,"At the start of a big week for the Higgs boson, the most sought-after particle in all of physics, scientists in Illinois said Monday that they had crept closer to proving that the particle exists but had been unable to reach a definitive conclusion.The scientists outlined their final analysis based on more than 10 years of research and 500 trillion particle collisions using the U.S. Department of Energy's Fermilab Tevatron collider near Batavia, Illinois, whose budgetary woes shut it down last year.What is the Higgs boson and why is it important?Their announcement came two days before researchers at the Large Hadron Collider under the Alps are due to unveil their latest results at an eagerly awaited seminar at the CERN particle physics laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland."

5,"(CNN) -- Visits to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine by Japanese officials, including the younger brother of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, ignited criticism from China and Korea, which see the visits as an homage to Japan's past wartime aggressions.Over the weekend several officials, including Abe's brother, senior vice foreign minister Nobuo Kishi, visited the shrine, according to Kyodo News.
""On Sunday, Abe's cabinet minister Keiji Furuya visited the Yasukuni Shrine and maintained that he did not want to ""irritate neighboring nations.""
""The cycle of Japanese politicians visiting Yasukuni, prompting foreign criticisms, is well-worn.
""In a sense, if the Chinese government or Korean government criticizes Japan for doing this, this gives them (Japanese politicians) attention."

That way, we did not have to admit to the world and each other that whatever the Karzai government is -- one of the most corrupt governments in the world, a foundation of a new narcostate -- democracy it ain't, by a long shot.How much our entanglement in Afghanistan is turning into a sad farce became all too clear when President Obama flew to Kabul to tell Karzai that he ought to stop corruption.When, in response, Karzai started negotiating a peace deal with the Taliban, the White House rolled out the red carpet for Karzai and announced that from now on, the U.S. will focus on low-level corruption."

The end of the Soviet Union was understood by many of us not as an end to ideology, but as proof that our ideology was the better one.Just why Eric Hobsbawm thought as he did, wrote as he did, and lived as he did is a matter that is beyond the judgement of any one of his colleagues, and there are people far better equipped than I to judge."

Opponents go on record as well, and when a policy turns out to be popular and successful this makes them much more hesitant to continue their attacks on a program.For decades, Republicans shied away from the kind of oppositional statements toward Medicare proposals uttered by Barry Goldwater and Reagan in the early 1960s for fear that voters would remember how they had stood firm against benefits that turned out to be enormously popular.Obama certainly would prefer to obtain legislation and the turn to executive power is a decision of last resort, one that realistically might be the only way he can achieve anything else in the next few years."

491,"(CNN) -- Cristiano Ronaldo helped Real Madrid move three points clear in Spain ahead of the winter break with his fifth hat-trick this season in Saturday's 6-2 win at Sevilla, as both teams had a player sent off.The Portugal forward claimed outright top spot in the La Liga scoring charts as he moved clear of Lionel Messi, who is in Japan with Barcelona for Sunday's FIFA Club World Cup final against Brazilian side Santos.Real, smarting from last weekend's 3-1 home defeat by the Spanish and European champions, made the perfect start when Ronaldo ran onto Angel Di Maria's threaded pass to net in the 10th minute.Goalkeeper Iker Casillas did well to stop Sevilla making an immediate reply, with the Spain captain pushing Manu's shot onto the post.Sevilla thought they had equalized in the 35th minute but Emir Spahic's effort was ruled out for a marginal offside following Ivan Rakitic's free-kick out wide, and Real doubled the home team's anguish by immediately doubling the lead.Jose Callejon, who like Ronaldo scored in the midweek Copa del Rey first-leg win over third division Ponferradina, was credited with another goal after making enough contact with Di Maria's chip into the box to distract keeper Javi Varas.Ronaldo made it 3-0 in the 41st minute with his 19th league goal this season after being given too much space to shoot from outside the box.However, Real went to the interval reduced to 10 men after defender Pepe was sent off for striking the face of former Madrid striker Alvaro Negredo.Sevilla could not capitalize on that advantage, and Di Maria was finally rewarded in the 66th minute when he ran onto Karim Benzema's first-time pass and coolly slotted low past Varas.Jesus Navas reduced the deficit when he fired through the legs of defender Sergio Ramos in the 69th minute, but Manu was red-carded for a rash tackle from behind on Madrid fullback Alvaro Arbeloa.Ronaldo netted from the penalty spot with five minutes left -- sealing his 13th treble for Real --after Benzema was fouled by Federico Fazio in a challenge that saw the France forward carried off.His replacement Hamit Altintop then scored his first league goal for Real, with the Turkey midfielder netting from Xabi Alonso's low cross.Negredo hit back in the second minute of time added on for his fifth in La Liga to ensure a repeat scoreline from last season's fixture.The defeat left Sevilla 16 points behind Real after 16 games, and facing the prospect of losing fifth place to Malaga -- who visit third-placed Valencia on Sunday.Espanyol moved up to seventh with a 2-1 win at Sporting Gijon that left the Barcelona-based club a point behind Sevilla and Malaga.Sergio Garcia netted the winner with six minutes left, after captain David Barral equalized for third-bottom Gijon with his seventh goal this season in the 61st minute.French teenager Thievy Bifouma put Espanyol ahead after only two minutes as the 19-year-old fired home from outside the box.Athletic Bilbao beat bottom club Real Zaragoza 2-1 to move up to eighth, despite having Spain midfielder Javi Martinez sent off midway through the first half.Leonardo Ponzio put the visitors level from the resulting penalty, but his teammate Maurizio Lanzaro was dismissed for a second booking on 69 and Gaizka Toquero netted the Basque side's winner with three minutes to play.Getafe joined 10th-placed Atletico Madrid on 19 points with a 2-1 win at Real Mallorca as Abdel Barrada netted both goals.Defender Ivan Ramis headed Mallorca into a 10th-minute lead, but Pedro Rios helped 22-year-old French midfielder Barrada score on 28 and 44."

494,"(CNN) -- The Syrian president sacked the governor of a restive province, a day after tens of thousands of anti-government protesters took to the streets of its capital.President Bashar al-Assad discharged Dr. Ahmad Khaled Abdul-Aziz from his post as governor of Hama province, the third provincial governor to be fired since the countrywide protests began in mid-March.No reason was given for the move, reported on Saturday by the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency.Hama city, the provincial capital, has been the scene of very large demonstrations and the outpourings there have been compared to the gatherings in Cairo's Tahrir Square, where daily demonstrations earlier this year forced the removal of Egyptian strongman Hosni Mubarak.Security forces withdrew from the Hama city center last month and al-Aasi Square has been packed with protesters calling for the downfall of the regime, displays of grassroots anger that have been gaining momentum in recent days.There have been no recent reports of violence in Hama, and observers believe the government might have been allowing the demonstrations in Hama because of the sensitivities over the city's violent history.The city was the scene of a 1982 brutal military crackdown targeting Sunni Muslims by the Alawite-dominated government of Hafez al-Assad, Bashar al-Assad's late father."
